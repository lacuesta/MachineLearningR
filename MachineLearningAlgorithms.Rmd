# Nearest neighbors algorithm
Pros:
- Simple and effective
- No assumptions about the underliying data distribution
- Fast training phase

Cons:
- Does not produce a model
- Slow classification phase
- Requires a large amount of memory
- Nominal features and missing data require additional processing

## kNN algorithm
The kNN algorithm uses a dataset composed of examples classified
in several categories, as labeled by a nominal variable. kNN identifies k
records that are the nearest in similarity.
The features should be transformed to a standard range before applying the kNN algorithm, as min-max normalization or z-score standarization.

### Building the classifier and making predictions
Function 'knn()' in the 'class' package,
```{r}
p <- knn(train, test, class, k)
```
- train: data frame containing numeric training data
- test: data frame containing numeric test data
- class: factor vector with the class for each row in the training data
- k: integer indcating the number of nearest neighbors

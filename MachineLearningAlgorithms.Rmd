# Nearest neighbors algorithm
Pros:
- Simple and effective
- No assumptions about the underliying data distribution
- Fast training phase

Cons:
- Does not produce a model
- Slow classification phase
- Requires a large amount of memory
- Nominal features and missing data require additional processing

## kNN algorithm


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
